A graph is a set of nodes that are connected to each other in the form of a network. First of all,
weâ€™ll define the two basic components of a graph.

1) A vertex is an essential part of a graph. A collection of vertices forms a graph.
  In that sense, vertices are similar to linked list nodes.

2) An edge is a link between two vertices. It can be uni-directional or bi-directional, depending on your graph. An edge can also have a cost associated with it,
   which we will discuss in detail later.
